Welcome!  In this course you will be introduced to a powerful new tool - Microsoft Excel.  Microsoft Excel (or Excel) is a spreadsheet tool created by Microsoft in the mid-1980's.  A spreadsheet allows a user to organize data (numbers or text) in a tabular format of columns and rows, and then allows for calculations to be applied on this data.  Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets, using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter-named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It has a large number of builtin functions to answer statistical, engineering and financial questions. 
In addition, it can display data as line graphs, histograms and charts. 
Excel 2016 has 484 functions. Of these, 360 existed prior to Excel 2010. Microsoft classifies these functions in 14 categories.
